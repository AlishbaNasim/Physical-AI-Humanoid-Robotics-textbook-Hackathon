# Overview of ROS 2 and Humanoid Robotics

## Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book will take you through the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) and its critical role in developing humanoid robotic systems.

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

### Key Features of ROS 2

- **Distributed computing**: Multiple processes can communicate seamlessly, whether running on the same device or distributed across multiple machines.
- **Language independence**: Support for multiple programming languages including C++, Python, and others.
- **Real-time support**: Improved real-time capabilities compared to ROS 1.
- **Improved security**: Built-in security features for safer robot operation.
- **Middleware abstraction**: Support for different communication middleware (DDS implementations).

## Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots are robots with physical characteristics that resemble the human body. They typically have a head, torso, two arms, and two legs, though some variations exist. The development of humanoid robots requires sophisticated control systems, which is where ROS 2 becomes essential.

### Why Use ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics?

1. **Modular Architecture**: The component-based approach allows for easier development and maintenance of complex humanoid systems.
2. **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive libraries and tools for perception, navigation, manipulation, and more.
3. **Simulation Support**: Excellent integration with simulation environments like Gazebo.
4. **Community**: Large community of researchers and developers contributing to the ecosystem.
