# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Focus and Theme: AI Systems in the Physical World. Embodied Intelligence.

Goal: Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body. Students apply their AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.

This comprehensive guide explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, focusing on how AI systems can be applied to control and interact with physical robots, particularly humanoid robots. Through this book, you will learn about:

- The fundamentals of AI in physical systems
- ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic applications
- Simulation environments for testing robotic AI
- Control systems for humanoid robots
- Vision-language-action systems for robot interaction

## Getting Started

This book is structured into four main modules that will guide you from basic concepts to advanced implementations in humanoid robotics:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Understanding the communication and control infrastructure
2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Creating simulation environments for testing
3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Implementing AI decision-making for robots
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Advanced interaction systems

Each module builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to develop AI systems for humanoid robots.
